We are presenting you Code4Kids. Our vision is to help a new community which recently has been added into the programming realm by the NEW EDUCATION POLICY under which the government has mandated all students to learn coding and why not? Isn't coding fun?

# Clone And Use 📋

- The website is completely built using `html\CSS` and `javascript` and that's why we need `npm` installed.
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page.
- After the successful installation of `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  - ```python
    ```
  - This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  - ```python
    npm install
    ```
- Now, the project is ready to use.
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.

# Problem Statement ✏️

On the dawn of a **pandemic**, which almost broke most countries’ bones have set back many people's hope, but in this time of adversity, mankind has seen and realized things which might not have been brought up if it wasn’t for this spread. Of course, I am talking about **online teaching**. After the pandemic growth rate held a bit, students found themselves sitting in front of a laptop attending their classes, and even graduations.

Amid all of this, the Indian Government took a major step in regard to the future of its youth. They implemented the **NEW EDUCATION POLICY** or NEP which mandates all students from classes 6th to 12 to have coding knowledge. Now, this will be a huge addition to the existing community of programming and students can start learning from a little age. BUT, there comes a pause, we know there are plenty of resources present to learn to program, but is there any right guidance. If not, then we fear that teaching programming will be a business and it will become the NEXT Money Making Scheme for coaching institutes when they will see the opportunity. We believe that Knowledge should be **free** when we have this opportunity.

# Solution 🌈

I personally am greatly influenced by Mr. Salman, CEO of KhanAcademy, and marking onto his steps I want to provide free education but the quality must be top-notch.
We made a website to i.e code4kids to help the new community which is getting added to have the best premium resources **FOR FREE** . We have made a portal where students can come learn a topic and test themselves on some quiz and be proficient. Just like Khan Academy were will be providing best knowledge of computer science in a friendly manner.We are working hard to ensure that Code4Kids provide best teaching present out there and take no money. We take proud in that and it is our hobby. 

We believe that the old fashioned ways of teaching with blackboard should be challenged and new learning resources are the bright future of education systems worldwide.
